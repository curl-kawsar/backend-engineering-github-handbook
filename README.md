## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control. It allows developers to:
- Store and manage code repositories
- Track changes in code over time
- Collaborate with other developers
- Contribute to open-source projects
- Host websites and documentation

### Key Concepts

- **Repository (Repo)**: A project folder containing your code and files
- **Git**: Version control system that tracks changes
- **Commit**: A snapshot of your code at a specific point in time
- **Branch**: A parallel version of your repository
- **Fork**: A copy of someone else's repository
- **Pull Request**: A request to merge changes into a repository

## Version Control with GitHub

Version control is the backbone of modern software development. GitHub uses Git to track every change in your codebase, creating a complete history of your project's evolution.

### Why Version Control Matters

**Track Changes**
- See exactly what changed, when, and who made the change
- Compare different versions of files
- Understand the evolution of your project

**Revert Changes**
- Undo problematic changes safely
- Roll back to any previous version
- Experiment without fear of breaking things

**Parallel Development**
- Multiple developers can work on different features simultaneously
- Merge changes from different contributors
- Resolve conflicts when changes overlap

**Documentation**
- Every change includes a commit message explaining why
- Link commits to issues and pull requests
- Maintain release notes and changelogs

### How GitHub Implements Version Control

#### 1. Repository Structure

```
Repository
├── Working Directory (your local files)
├── Staging Area (files ready to commit)
├── Local Repository (.git folder)
└── Remote Repository (GitHub server)
```

#### 2. The Three States of Files

```bash
# Modified - file has changes but not staged
echo "new content" >> file.txt
git status  # Shows file as modified

# Staged - file is ready to be committed
git add file.txt
git status  # Shows file as staged

# Committed - file is saved in repository history
git commit -m "Add new content to file"
git status  # Working directory clean
```

#### 3. Version History Timeline

```
A---B---C---D (main branch)
     \
      E---F (feature branch)
```

Each letter represents a commit with:
- Unique SHA hash (e.g., `a1b2c3d4`)
- Author and timestamp
- Commit message
- Complete snapshot of all files

#### 4. Branching for Version Control

```bash
# Create version for new feature
git checkout -b feature/user-authentication

# Work on feature
git add .
git commit -m "Add login form"
git commit -m "Add password validation"
git commit -m "Add user session management"

# Merge back to main when ready
git checkout main
git merge feature/user-authentication
```

### Version Control Workflows

#### 1. Linear Development
```
A---B---C---D---E (main)
```
Simple, sequential commits on main branch.

#### 2. Feature Branch Workflow
```
A---B---E---F (main)
     \     /
      C---D (feature)
```
Develop features in separate branches, merge when complete.

#### 3. Git Flow
```
A---B---E---H (main)
     \     /
      C---D (develop)
       \
        F---G (feature)
```
Structured workflow with main, develop, and feature branches.

#### 4. Release Management
```bash
# Tag releases for version control
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0

# Create release branches
git checkout -b release/v1.1.0
# ... make release preparations
git checkout main
git merge release/v1.1.0
git tag -a v1.1.0 -m "Release version 1.1.0"
```

### Tracking Changes Over Time

#### View File History
```bash
# See all changes to a specific file
git log --follow filename.txt

# See changes with diffs
git log -p filename.txt

# See who changed what line
git blame filename.txt
```

#### Compare Versions
```bash
# Compare working directory with last commit
git diff HEAD

# Compare two commits
git diff commit1 commit2

# Compare branches
git diff main feature-branch
```

#### Restore Previous Versions
```bash
# Restore file from specific commit
git checkout commit-hash -- filename.txt

# Restore entire project to previous state
git checkout commit-hash

# Create new branch from old commit
git checkout -b fix-branch commit-hash
```

## Collaborative Development

GitHub transforms individual coding into team collaboration. Here's how developers work together effectively using GitHub's collaborative features.

### Team Collaboration Models

#### 1. Centralized Workflow
- Single shared repository
- All team members have write access
- Direct commits to main branch (for small teams)

```bash
# Team member workflow
git clone https://github.com/team/project.git
git pull origin main          # Get latest changes
# ... make changes ...
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"
git push origin main          # Share with team
```

#### 2. Feature Branch Workflow
- Each feature developed in separate branch
- Pull requests for code review
- Merge after approval

```bash
# Developer A creates feature
git checkout -b feature/shopping-cart
# ... develop feature ...
git push origin feature/shopping-cart
# Create pull request on GitHub

# Developer B reviews and merges
# ... code review process ...
git checkout main
git pull origin main          # Get merged changes
```

#### 3. Forking Workflow
- Each developer has their own fork
- Contribute via pull requests
- Maintainers control the main repository

```bash
# Contributor workflow
# 1. Fork repository on GitHub
# 2. Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yourname/project.git
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original/project.git

# 3. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-functionality

# 4. Make changes and push to your fork
git push origin feature/new-functionality

# 5. Create pull request to original repository
```

### Collaborative Development Process

#### 1. Planning and Issue Management

**Create Issues for Everything**
```markdown
# Bug Report
**Bug Description:** Login button doesn't work on mobile
**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Open app on mobile device
2. Navigate to login page
3. Tap login button
**Expected:** User should be logged in
**Actual:** Nothing happens

**Labels:** bug, mobile, high-priority
**Assignee:** @frontend-dev
**Milestone:** v2.1.0
```

**Project Planning**
- Use GitHub Projects for kanban boards
- Create milestones for releases
- Link issues to pull requests

#### 2. Code Development Workflow

**Step 1: Assign and Start Work**
```bash
# Assign issue to yourself
# Create branch from issue
git checkout -b 123-fix-mobile-login

# Reference issue in commits
git commit -m "Fix mobile login button (#123)

- Add touch event handlers
- Improve button styling for mobile
- Add responsive CSS

Fixes #123"
```

**Step 2: Collaborative Coding**
```bash
# Regular sync with team
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main        # Keep history clean

# Push work-in-progress
git push origin 123-fix-mobile-login

# Team members can check out your branch
git fetch origin
git checkout 123-fix-mobile-login
```

#### 3. Code Review Process

**Creating Effective Pull Requests**
```markdown

# Request changes or approve
```

#### 4. Team Communication

**Using GitHub for Communication**

**Comments and Discussions**
- Comment on commits for specific questions
- Use issue comments for ongoing discussions
- @mention team members for notifications

**Code Review Comments**
```markdown
# Inline code comments
This function could be optimized by using a Map instead of nested loops.

# General PR comments
Great work on the mobile responsiveness! Just a few minor suggestions.

# Suggestion format
```suggestion
const userMap = new Map(users.map(u => [u.id, u]));
```
```

**Team Coordination**
- Use draft pull requests for work-in-progress
- Create team discussions for architectural decisions
- Use GitHub wiki for documentation

### Advanced Collaborative Features

#### 1. Protected Branches
```yaml
# Branch protection rules
- Require pull request reviews
- Require status checks to pass
- Require branches to be up to date
- Restrict pushes to main branch
```

#### 2. Code Owners
```bash
# .github/CODEOWNERS
# Global owners
* @team-lead @senior-dev

# Frontend files
/src/components/ @frontend-team
/src/styles/ @ui-designer

# Backend files
/api/ @backend-team
/database/ @database-admin

# Documentation
/docs/ @tech-writer
README.md @team-lead
```

#### 3. Automated Workflows
```yaml
# .github/workflows/team-collaboration.yml
name: Team Collaboration

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  notify-team:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Notify Slack
        uses: 8398a7/action-slack@v3
        with:
          status: custom
          custom_payload: |
            {
              text: "New PR ready for review: ${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}"
            }
```

### Conflict Resolution

#### 1. Merge Conflicts
```bash
# When conflicts occur during merge
git merge feature-branch
# Auto-merging file.txt
# CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in file.txt

# Edit conflicted files
<<<<<<< HEAD
Current branch content
=======
Feature branch content
>>>>>>> feature-branch

# Resolve conflicts and commit
git add file.txt
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict in file.txt"
```

#### 2. Communication During Conflicts
```markdown
# Comment on PR when conflicts arise
@developer-name There are merge conflicts in this PR. The main branch has been updated with changes to the same files. Could you please:

1. Rebase your branch on the latest main
2. Resolve the conflicts
3. Force push the updated branch

Let me know if you need help with the conflict resolution!
```

### Team Best Practices

#### 1. Commit Message Standards
```bash
# Team commit message format
type(scope): description

# Examples
feat(auth): add two-factor authentication
fix(api): resolve null pointer in user endpoint
docs(readme): update installation instructions
style(css): fix button alignment on mobile
refactor(utils): extract common validation functions
test(auth): add unit tests for login flow
```

#### 2. Branch Naming Conventions
```bash
# Feature branches
feature/user-authentication
feature/shopping-cart
feature/payment-integration

# Bug fix branches
fix/mobile-login-issue
fix/memory-leak-in-parser
hotfix/critical-security-patch

# Release branches
release/v2.1.0
release/v2.2.0-beta
```

#### 3. Code Review Guidelines
- Review within 24 hours
- Be constructive and specific
- Test changes locally when possible
- Approve only when confident
- Use suggestions for minor changes

#### 4. Documentation Standards
- Update README for new features
- Document API changes
- Maintain changelog
- Write clear commit messages
- Comment complex code sections

This collaborative approach ensures that teams can work efficiently together, maintain code quality, and deliver reliable software while keeping everyone informed and aligned.

1. Go to repository Settings
2. Scroll to Pages section
3. Select source branch
4. Your site will be available at `username.github.io/repository`

## Best Practices

### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commit format:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation
- `style`: Formatting
- `refactor`: Code restructuring
- `test`: Adding tests
- `chore`: Maintenance

Examples:
```
feat(auth): add user login functionality
fix(api): resolve null pointer exception
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

### Repository Structure

```
project/
├── .github/
│   ├── workflows/
│   ├── ISSUE_TEMPLATE/
│   └── PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
├── docs/
├── src/
├── tests/
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
├── LICENSE
└── package.json
```

### .gitignore

Common patterns:

```gitignore
# Dependencies
node_modules/
vendor/

# Build outputs
dist/
build/
*.min.js

# Environment files
.env
.env.local

# IDE files
.vscode/
.idea/
*.swp

# OS files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Logs
*.log
logs/
```

## Advanced Topics

### Git Hooks

Automate tasks with Git hooks:

```bash
# Pre-commit hook example
#!/bin/sh
# .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Run tests before commit
npm test
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Tests failed. Commit aborted."
    exit 1
fi
```

### Submodules

Include other repositories as subdirectories:

```bash
# Add submodule
git submodule add https://github.com/user/repo.git path/to/submodule

# Clone repository with submodules
git clone --recursive https://github.com/user/repo.git

# Update submodules
git submodule update --remote
```

### Advanced Git Commands

```bash
# Interactive rebase
git rebase -i HEAD~3

# Cherry-pick commits
git cherry-pick commit-hash

# Stash changes
git stash
git stash pop
git stash list

# Reset commits
git reset --soft HEAD~1    # Keep changes staged
git reset --mixed HEAD~1   # Keep changes unstaged
git reset --hard HEAD~1    # Discard changes

# Bisect (find bug-introducing commit)
git bisect start
git bisect bad
git bisect good commit-hash
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Merge Conflicts

```bash
# When merge conflict occurs
git status                  # See conflicted files
# Edit files to resolve conflicts
git add resolved-file.txt
git commit
```

#### Undo Last Commit

```bash
# Undo last commit (keep changes)
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Undo last commit (discard changes)
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Undo last commit (create new commit)
git revert HEAD
```

#### Force Push (Use Carefully)

```bash
# Force push (overwrites remote history)
git push --force-with-lease origin branch-name
```

#### Large File Issues

Use Git LFS for large files:

```bash
# Install Git LFS
git lfs install

# Track large files
git lfs track "*.psd"
git lfs track "*.zip"

# Add .gitattributes
git add .gitattributes
```
